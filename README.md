# har2requests

  - Step 1: Interact with a website from your usual browser
  - Step 2: automatically generate the Python code to replay your
    requests

## Motivation

To write bots in Python, the two main options are:

  - [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) to produce HTTP
    requests directly
  - [selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) to control a web
    browser

Of course, requests bots are more stable but they require more daunting
work to reverse engineer the javascript code and reproduce every request
made by the client.

## Features

  - Automatic requests code generation from a [HAR
    file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har)
  - Detection of the headers common to all requests and code
    factorization
  - Clever inference on the origin of authorization headers
  - Code formatting using [black](https://github.com/ambv/black)

## Installation

    pip install har2requests

## Usage

From Chrome or Firefox, go to the Network tab of the Developer Tools,
put the filters you want and export to HAR.

To read from a file:

    har2requests input.har > output.py

To read from the clipboard:

    pbpaste | har2requests - > output.py

When encountering errors, you can use the `--unsafe` feature that will display warnings
instead of errors if the HAR file does not fit the specification (it happens a lot).

# TODO

  - Use requests.Session
  - Handle cookies (e.g. with a session)
  - handle text field from post requests
